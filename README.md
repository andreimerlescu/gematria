# Go Gematria

This package provides you the ability to transform a string into 3 numbers called Gematria. The three numbers are: 

| Kind               | Example String | Example Score |
|--------------------|----------------|---------------|
| `GemScore.English` | `Andrei`       | `306`         |
| `GemScore.Jewish`  | `Andrei`       | `139`         |
| `GemScore.Simple`  | `Andrei`       | `51`          |

When tools like [Gematrix.org](https://gematrix.org?utm_source=projectapario&word=andrei) are used they return
interesting results that share the similar scores with their results. For example: 

| Kind | Score | Gematrix Entry |
|------|-------|----------------|
| English | 306 | Michael |
| English | 306 | BRICS |
| English | 306 | Batman |
| English | 306 | GESARA |
| English | 306 | Rome | 
| English | 306 | Micheal |
| English | 306 | Elite |


| Kind   | Score | Gematrix Entry |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Jewish | 139   | Google         |
| Jewish | 139   | Sin            |
| Jewish | 139   | Golden Age     |
| Jewish | 139   | Math           |
| Jewish | 139   | Nikolai        |
| Jewish | 139   | Agora          |


| Kind   | Score | Gematrix Entry |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Simple | 306   | Michael        |
| Simple | 306   | BRICS          |
| Simple | 306   | Batman         |
| Simple | 306   | GESARA         |
| Simple | 306   | Rome           | 
| Simple | 306   | Micheal        |
| Simple | 306   | Elite          |

Religious scholars have used Gematria as a mechanism for seeing relationships between words. Their relationships are
the numbers that they share in common with each other. Those numbers are governed by the laws of 3 6 and 9. The 
power of 3 6 and 9 is very real and you are encouraged to use it. Therefore, this package was created... so that you
may use it.

# Package Installation

You will need to download this package to your Go project should you wish to use it. 

```bash
go get -u github.com/andreimerlescu/go-gematria
```

# Usage

Here is an example program that uses this package.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	gematria "github.com/andreimerlescu/go-gematria"
)

func main(){
	name := "Andrei"
	gematria_score := gematria.NewGemScore(name)
	fmt.Printf("name = %v ; gematria = %v", name, gematria_score)
}
```

# Future Proof

This package has no dependencies and will not require to be updated in the future given that Gematria is effectively
a constant as unchangeable as the value of Pi. Therefore, the long term utilization of this package can safely be 
integrated into many types of projects.
